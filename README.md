# EmerCall
* Emergencies have a way of sapping our strength and rendering otherwise intelligent adults into hand-wringing, wailing lumps of hysterics. The surge of panic paralyzes rational thought, and suddenly you're at the mercy of prior preparation.

* In a perfect world, the type of world we all believed we would inhabit when we were still childless parenting experts, there would never be a need for emergency phone numbers, frantic calls to poison control, emergency doctor visits, or white-faced ambulance rides where the little boy who loves sirens finds himself in the belly of the siren king.
Alas, such a world is not the one we inhabit. Thankfully, we have access to emergency services when those events occur.

### Therefore I present you EmerCall >

* **EmerCall** is an emergency calling application which contains all the phone numbers a person needs at the time of emergency. The numbers are placed in categorised manner which makes the application simpler to use. This application also allows the user to make calls from the app itself.
